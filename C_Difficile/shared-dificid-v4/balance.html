      DIFICID is contraindicated in patients<br/>
      who have known hypersensitivity to<br/>
      fidaxomicin or any other ingredient in<br/>
      DIFICID.
  </li>
   <li>
      DIFICID should only be used for the<br/>
      treatment of  <span class="italic"> C. difficile</span>-associated<br/>
      diarrhea. DIFICID is not effective for<br/>
      treatment of other types of infections<br/>
      due to minimal systemic absorption of<br/>
      fidaxomicin.
  </li>
  <li>
      Acute hypersensitivity reactions,<br/>
      including dyspnea, rash pruritus,<br/>
      and angioedema of the mouth,<br/>
      throat, and face have been reported<br/>
      with fidaxomicin. If a severe<br/>
      hypersensitivity reaction occurs,<br/>
      DIFICID should be discontinued<br/>
      and appropriate therapy should be<br/>
      instituted.

   <li>
      Only use DIFICID for infection<br/>
      proven or strongly suspected to be<br/>
      caused by <span class="italic"> C. difficile</span>.Prescribing<br/>
      DIFICID in the absence of a proven<br/>
      or strongly suspected <span class="italic"> C. difficile</span><br/>
      infection is unlikely to provide benefit<br/>
      to the patient and increases the risk<br/>
      of development of drug-resistant<br/>
      bacteria.
  </li>
  <li>
      The most common adverse reactions<br/>
      reported in clinical trials are nausea<br/>
      (11%), vomiting (7%), abdominal pain<br/>
      (6%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage<br/>
      (4%), anemia (2%), and neutropenia<br/>

<div id="bal2">
  <li>
      Among patients receiving DIFICID,<br/>
      33 (5.9%) withdrew from trials as a<br/>
      result of adverse reactions. Vomiting<br/>
      was the primary adverse reaction<br/>
      leading to discontinuation of dosing<br/>
      (incidence of 0.5% for both DIFICID<br/>
      and vancomycin patients).<br/>

  <li>
      The safety and effectiveness of<br/>
      DIFICID in patients &lt;18 years of age<br/>
      have not been established.

  <li>
      The recommended dose of DIFICID<br/> is one 200 mg tablet orally twice daily<br/>
      for 10 days, with or without food.
  </li>
  <li>
      No dose adjustment is recommended<br/>
      for patients &ge;65 years of age.

  <li>
      No dose adjustment is recommended<br/>
      for patients with renal impairment.

  <li>
      No dosage adjustments are<br/> recommended when co-<br/>administering
      fidaxomicin with<br/> substrates of P-gp or CYP enzymes.

  <li>
      The impact of hepatic impairment <br/>
      on  the pharmacokinetics of <br/>fidaxomicin
      has not been evaluated; <br/>however,
      because fidaxomicin and <br/>its active
      metabolite (OP-1118) do <br/>not appear
      to undergo significant<br/> hepatic
      metabolism, elimination <br/>of fidaxomicin
      and OP-1118 is not <br/>expected to be
      significantly affected<br/> by hepatic
      impairment.
